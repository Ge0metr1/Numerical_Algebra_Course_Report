# Course design
This repository aims to solve the one-dimensional Possion equation with Dirilchlet boundaries by iterative methods like Jocobi, G-S, SOR.

1d.py is a test to solve the 1d discrete Possion equation, there is no work to the report.

1ddilichlet.py is a program to solve the 1d discrete Possion equation with Dirilchlet boundaries by three iterative methods Jocobi, G-S, SOR, and compare their difference.
